# Pacman-AI-Multi-Agent-Search
This repository contains my implementation of multi-agent search algorithms for Pacman, including minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and expectimax. By leveraging these algorithms and designing an effective evaluation function, I've enhanced Pacman's decision-making capabilities in navigating through complex mazes filled with ghosts.
